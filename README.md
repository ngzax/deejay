# DeeJay - True relational types for Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngzax/sip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ngzax/deejay)

So, first I started building [sip](https://github.com/sip-lang/sip) which is a dynamic, relational-functional language designed for hacking joy.

Now, that's a pretty big undertaking. But suddenly it hit me that I was starting out the wrong way.

Instead of building an entire language to implement D, I could (similar to the python project [Dee](http://www.quicksort.co.uk/))
simple write a D module for Elixir!

This is that.


## Usage

TBD


## Contributing

I (will eventually) appreciate contributions to deejay.

Everyone involved in the **deejay** project needs to understand and respect our Code of Conduct,

If you can code and abide by the simple Code of Conduct, 
please read the information in our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more information once it is available.

I also hope to eventually keep a list of features and bugs [in the issue tracker][1].
