## DeeJay - True relational types for Elixir

So, first I started building [sip](https://github.com/sip-lang/sip) which is a dynamic, relational-functional language designed for hacking joy.

Now, that's a pretty big undertaking. But suddenly it hit me that I was starting out the wrong way.

Instead of building an entire language to implement D, I could (similar to the python project [Dee](http://www.quicksort.co.uk/))
simple write a D module for Elixir!

This is that.
