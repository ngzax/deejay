# DeeJay - True relational types for Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngzax/sip.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ngzax/deejay)

So, first I started building [sip](https://github.com/sip-lang/sip) which is a dynamic, relational-functional language designed for hacking joy.

Now, that's a pretty big undertaking. But suddenly it hit me that I was starting out the wrong way.

Instead of building an entire language to implement D, I could (similar to the python project [Dee](http://www.quicksort.co.uk/))
simple write a D module for Elixir!

This is that.


## Usage

TBD


## Contributing

I (will eventually) appreciate contributions to deejay.

This project does not have a "Code of Conduct." 
If you need a written document telling you how to behave, this is not the project for you.

If you can hack and don't care at all about anything or than can the other people contributing hack too, 
please read the information in our [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for more information.

I hope to eventually keep a list of features and bugs [in the issue tracker][2].
